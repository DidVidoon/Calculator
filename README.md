# Calculator
This is a Consol Calculator created to showcase my skills. 
Two methods of use are implemented: In a console application (with simple operations (without parentheses). Operations are performed with mathematical priority (* / + -)) and work with files (the program reads data from the file line by line. Performs calculations with brackets and the result is written to a separate file).
